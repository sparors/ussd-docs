# Decisions {#decision}

Users are required to enter an input when a prompt is displayed to him/her. As a developer, you make decisions based on the users response. You will then navigate him/her to a different state based on the outcome of the decision. This is what decisions help you to do.

## Why the need for decisions?

Decisions provide you with common and frequently used logics to navigate to different states. This makes you focus on your application instead of creating functions for every application you build.
