# Manipulating Data {#manipulating-data}

The ussd state class has a property $record which is an instance of `Sparors\Ussd\Record` class. This will help you save, update, retrieve or delete data when the need arises.

## Saving Data

To save data use the set method of the record class.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Ussd;

use Sparors\Ussd\State;

class Welcome extends State
{
    protected function beforeRendering(): void
    {
        $this->record->set('visited_record', true);
    }

    protected function afterRendering(string $argument): void
    {
        $this->record->set('visited_record_again', true);
    }
}
```

### Saving multiple data

To save multiple data at onces use the setMuliple

```php

$record->setMultiple(['name' => 'Isaac', 'age' => 17, 'amount' => 3.50]);

```

#### Automatic Expiration

Sometimes, you don't want your cache to be filled with state data. You will want to automatically delete the old data. Set the expiration time you want in seconds.

```php

$record->set('name' => 'Isaac', 86400); // One day in seconds

```

You can also use datetime instead
```php

$record->setMultiple(['name' => 'Isaac', 'age' => 17, 'amount' => 3.50], now()->addDays(7));

```

#### Updating Records

When you set a record that already exists, the value is overwritten in the cache.

```php
$record->set('name', 'Tom');

$record->set('name', 'Jerry'); // Tom will update to Jerry.
```

## Check Record exist

To check if a record is set and not null, use the has method

```php
if ($record->has('name')) {
    echo "Name Already Set";
} else {
    echo "Name Not Set";
}
```

## Retrieve Data

Use the get method to retrive saved data. Null will be returned when key not found

```php
$name = $record->get('name');

```

### Retrive Multiple

You can retrieve more than one day at a go.

```php
[$name, $age] = $record->getMultiple(['name', 'age']);
```

#### Setting default

Sometimes, you want to get something else when data can not be found instead of null. You can set the default value.

```php
$name = $record->get('name', 'Ussd User');

[$balanceBefore, $balanceAfter] = $record->getMultiple(['balance_before', 'balance_after'], 0.00);
```

## Deleting Records

To delete single records use the delete method

```php
$record->delete('name');
```

### Delete Multiple

To delete more than one at a time, use setMultiple

```php
$record->deleteMultiple(['name', 'age']);
```
