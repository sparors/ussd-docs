This is a sample State class generated:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Ussd;

use Sparors\Ussd\State;

class Welcome extends State
{
    protected function beforeRendering(): void
    {
        //
    }

    protected function afterRendering(string $argument): void
    {
        //
    }
}
```

## The *beforeRendering* Method {#before-rendering-method}

## The *afterRendering* Method {#after-rendering-method}

This primary purpose of this method is to given you the privilege to specify which state the user should see next after examining his input. The input is the param string argument passed to the method.
